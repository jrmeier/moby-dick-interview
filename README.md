# üêã Moby Dick Interview üêã
Sorry, you don't actually get to talk a person named Moby Dick.


## Getting Started
So this should be relatively simple. All you need is 10.5 or greater and you should be good to go. If you don't have the right version of Node.js, I use NVM and its extremely slick.

First get the code 

`git clone git@github.com:jrmeier/moby-dick-interview.git`

Then install the requirements

`npm install`

Once that's installed, you'll be to ready to explore the data!

All that's left is to build the data file and start the React app.

`npm start`

Now running this the first time is going to be a bit slow. This is where it actually entire Moby Dick book is read and analyzed (hint: start [here](https://github.com/jrmeier/moby-dick-interview/blob/master/analyze.js)). The data file will be a JSON file, labeled mobydict_analyzed.json. I removed it from this last commit, just so you could make sure I'm doing real work ;).

Once the data file is built and the app is running, head to http://localhost:3000 to see it in action. Be sure to check out all the charting options!
